# Interpreting CNN with gradCAM in PyTorch
## Junting Ren
This repository contains my own implementation code in PyTorch for classification of different views of adult mouse brains, with interpretable gradCAM implementation. The corresponding data can be downloaded at https://allensdk.readthedocs.io/en/latest/allensdk.api.queries.mouse_atlas_api.html .
